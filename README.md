### Help wanted

- whiskers that droop (using bezierTo)
- more colors (or color sets, colors that work well together)
- mismatched eye colors
- accessories
- different mouths
- an 8-bit version
- different backgrounds (polka dots? gradients? strips? chevrons? stars?)

### TODO

- document how to add new parts
- use 'translate, then draw' style of drawing to make drawing easier
  (removes X and Y from each draw call)
