### How to add a new part

Let's say you wanted to add tabby markings, you could accomplish that with
these steps:

- make a new file for the drawing code: `./parts/tabby-markings.js`
- put a function in `module.exports` of that file that takes `ctx` and
  `options` parameters
- add options to `generate-cat.js` if it makes sense to (for example maybe you
  want to be able to expose some of the parameters for tweaking)
- import your module from the module that will call it, in this case
  `./parts/head-markings.js` and call it where it makes sense to (in this case
  by adding it to the list of randomly-chosen facial marking functions)

### Help wanted!

- more colors (or color sets, colors that work well together)
- accessories (glasses, snacks, toys, hats)
- different mouths, eyes, noses, stripes, fur patterns
  - notched ears
  - pointy ears
  - triangle noses
- an 8-bit version
- different backgrounds (polka dots? gradients? stripes? chevrons? stars?)
- reference images of cartoon cat faces for inspiration, maybe a `./reference`
  directory?
- filters?
  - ascii using [aalib.js](https://github.com/moriyoshi/aalib.js) or
    [ascii](http://npm.im/ascii)?
  - glitch mode
